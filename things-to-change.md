Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while scrolling the mouse wheel to move the timeline horizontally.

This behavior is controlled in `Preferences > User > UI Settings`.  If `"2D Timeline Scrolling"` is enabled, you must hold Ctrl/Cmd to scroll left/right.  If disabled, the mouse wheel scrolls vertically by default.
